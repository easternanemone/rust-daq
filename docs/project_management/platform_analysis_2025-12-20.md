# Deep Analysis: rust-daq as a Scientific Experiment Development Platform
**Date:** 2025-12-20
**Analyst:** Claude Code
**Purpose:** Comprehensive platform analysis for user-friendly, interactive, scientific experiment automation

## Executive Summary

rust-daq implements a **headless-first V5 architecture** for scientific instrument control and data acquisition. It demonstrates strong architectural foundations (capability-based HAL, Bluesky-inspired orchestration, document-oriented data model) but has significant gaps preventing it from being a **truly user-friendly platform** for laboratory researchers.

**Current State:** Excellent technical foundation (v0.5.0), limited accessibility
**Target State:** Interactive experiment development platform accessible to non-programmers

---

## 1. Architecture Analysis

### 1.1 Current Strengths

**V5 Headless-First Design:**
- Daemon (`rust-daq-daemon`) exposes hardware via gRPC
- GUI (`rust-daq-gui`) as pure gRPC client
- Clear separation: presentation layer fully decoupled from business logic
- Enables remote control, multiple clients, headless deployment

**Modular Crate Structure:**
- `daq-core`: Foundation types, capabilities, errors
- `daq-hardware`: Capability-based HAL with real drivers (PVCAM, Thorlabs ELL14, Newport ESP300, MaiTai laser)
- `daq-experiment`: RunEngine with Bluesky-inspired Plan system
- `daq-scripting`: Rhai embedded scripting (Python planned)
- `daq-storage`: Multi-backend persistence (CSV, HDF5, Arrow)
- `daq-server`: gRPC server with streaming support
- `daq-egui`: Native GUI with real-time visualization
- `rust-daq`: Integration layer with organized prelude

**Data Pipeline ("Mullet Strategy"):**
- Reliable path: Backpressure + Ring buffer for guaranteed storage
- Lossy path: Broadcast channels for low-latency visualization
- Smart tradeoff between data integrity and responsiveness

**Capability-Based Hardware Abstraction:**
```rust
trait Movable { async fn move_abs(&self, position: f64) -> Result<()>; }
trait Readable { async fn read(&self) -> Result<Measurement>; }
trait FrameProducer { async fn arm(&self) -> Result<()>; }
trait Triggerable { async fn trigger(&self) -> Result<()>; }
```
- Flexible composition, easy mocking, extensible
- Contrast with inheritance hierarchies: more adaptable

**Reactive Parameter System:**
- `Parameter<T>` with hardware callbacks and validation
- Observable pattern for GUI/client synchronization
- Prevents "split brain" where hardware state diverges from application state

### 1.2 Architectural Gaps (User-Friendly Platform Perspective)

**1. Experiment Definition is Programmer-Centric**
- **Current:** Plans written in Rust or low-level Rhai scripts
- **Gap:** No visual experiment designer, no drag-and-drop workflow
- **Impact:** Requires programming knowledge to design experiments

**2. RunEngine/Plans Underutilized**
- **Current:** RunEngine exists but minimal Plan implementations
- **Gap:** No library of common scientific workflows (grid scan, time series, parameter sweep, optimization loops)
- **Impact:** Users reinvent the wheel for standard experiments

**3. Hardware Configuration is File-Based**
- **Current:** TOML config files (e.g., `config/demo.toml`)
- **Gap:** No GUI-based hardware setup wizard, no auto-discovery, no validation feedback
- **Impact:** Manual editing error-prone, intimidating for non-programmers

**4. Scripting is Low-Level**
- **Current:** Rhai scripts call device methods directly (`camera.arm()`, `stage.move_abs()`)
- **Gap:** No high-level "recipes" or templates, no block-based scripting
- **Impact:** Requires understanding hardware protocols

**5. Data Analysis is External**
- **Current:** Data saved to HDF5/CSV, analyzed separately (Python/MATLAB)
- **Gap:** No built-in analysis pipeline, no live computation
- **Impact:** Disconnected workflow, slow feedback loops

**6. GUI is Device-Centric, Not Experiment-Centric**
- **Current:** GUI organized by devices (Devices panel, Scripts panel)
- **Gap:** No "Experiment" panel, no experimental design workflow, no run history browser
- **Impact:** Users think in terms of devices, not experiments

---

## 2. User Experience Analysis

### 2.1 User Personas

**Persona 1: Laboratory Researcher (Non-Programmer)**
- **Goal:** Automate repeated measurements (e.g., daily calibration, overnight data collection)
- **Needs:** Point-and-click configuration, simple scripting (if-then logic), email alerts
- **Current Pain:** Must learn Rust or Rhai, edit TOML files, debug gRPC errors

**Persona 2: Graduate Student (Basic Programming)**
- **Goal:** Design custom experiments (parameter sweeps, optimization, multi-device synchronization)
- **Needs:** Script templates, debugging tools, data preview, undo/redo
- **Current Pain:** No experiment templates, limited debugging (print statements), no in-app data viewer

**Persona 3: Instrumentation Developer (Expert)**
- **Goal:** Integrate new hardware, optimize performance, build reusable modules
- **Needs:** Driver SDK, performance profiling, testing framework
- **Current Strengths:** Good HAL abstraction, async runtime, capability traits
- **Current Pain:** Feature flag duplication, specialized binaries missing

### 2.2 Critical User Journey: "Run My First Automated Scan"

**Current Experience (v0.5.0):**
1. Install Rust toolchain (30 min)
2. Clone repo, run `cargo build` (10 min)
3. Read Getting Started panel (5 min)
4. Start daemon: `cargo run --bin rust-daq-daemon -- daemon --hardware-config config/demo.toml`
5. Connect GUI to daemon
6. Write Rhai script from scratch or modify examples
7. Upload script via GUI (v0.6.0 feature, not yet implemented)
8. Manually trigger execution
9. Export data, analyze externally

**Ideal Experience:**
1. Download binary (2 min)
2. Launch GUI, click "New Experiment Wizard"
3. Select devices from auto-discovered list
4. Choose experiment type (Grid Scan template)
5. Fill in parameters visually (start/stop/steps with unit validation)
6. Preview execution graph
7. Click "Run", see live plots
8. Export with one click, or run built-in analysis

**Gap:** 8 steps → 7 steps, but qualitative difference in accessibility

## 3. Automation & Scripting Capabilities

### 3.1 Current State

**Rhai Scripting Engine:**
- Embedded language, Rust-like syntax
- Type-safe bindings to hardware APIs
- Examples: `demo_camera.rhai` (working), `demo_scan.rhai` (v0.6.0 placeholder)

**Script Execution Modes:**
1. **One-shot:** Direct execution with hardcoded mock devices (v0.5.0)
2. **Daemon:** gRPC-based execution with config-file devices (v0.6.0)

**Current Bindings (daq-scripting/src/bindings.rs):**
```rhai
camera.arm()
camera.trigger()
stage.move_abs(position)
sleep(duration_seconds)
print(message)
```

### 3.2 Automation Gaps

**1. No Conditional Logic Examples**
- **Missing:** If-then-else templates (e.g., "if power > threshold, stop scan")
- **Missing:** Error handling patterns (retry logic, fallback strategies)

**2. No Loop Abstractions**
- **Current:** Users write `for i in 0..10 { ... }` manually
- **Missing:** High-level "scan" command (e.g., `scan(stage, 0, 10, 11)`)

**3. No Event-Driven Automation**
- **Missing:** Triggers (e.g., "start acquisition when stage reaches position")
- **Missing:** Watchdogs (e.g., "alert if temperature > 50°C")

**4. No Experiment Scheduling**
- **Missing:** Cron-like scheduling, queue management
- **Missing:** Dependencies between experiments (run B after A succeeds)

**5. No Data-Driven Workflows**
- **Missing:** Real-time decision making (adaptive sampling based on live data)
- **Missing:** Feedback loops (optimize parameter based on measurement)

### 3.3 Recommendations

**Short-Term (v0.6.0):**
- Implement daemon device registration (complete `demo_scan.rhai`)
- Add high-level Rhai functions: `scan_1d()`, `scan_grid()`, `wait_for()`
- Create script template library in GUI

**Medium-Term (v0.7.0):**
- Block-based scripting UI (Blockly/Scratch-like)

## 11. Conclusion

rust-daq has **world-class technical foundations** but remains **programmer-centric**. Transforming it into a **user-friendly scientific platform** requires:

1. **Closing the Execution Gap:** Finish v0.6.0 features (daemon device registration, script UI)
2. **Democratizing Experiment Design:** Plan library, templates, visual tools
3. **Integrating Analysis:** Live computation, data browser, visualization
4. **Lowering Barriers:** Pre-built binaries, wizards, tutorials
5. **Building Community:** Forums, examples, documentation

**Strategic Priority:** Focus v0.6.0 on **completion** (make existing features work end-to-end) rather than **expansion** (add new capabilities). This builds credibility and usability momentum.

**Target Outcome:** By v0.7.0, a laboratory researcher should be able to:
- Download binary → configure devices via GUI → design experiment from template → run and visualize → export results **without writing code or editing files**.

This positions rust-daq as the **modern open-source alternative to LabView** for scientific automation.
