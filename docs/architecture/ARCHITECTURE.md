# Rust DAQ Architecture Analysis

## Overview

`rust-daq` is a modular, high-performance data acquisition system built in Rust. It follows a workspace-based architecture with a clear separation of concerns between core types, hardware abstraction, experiment orchestration, storage, and network interfaces.

## Crate Hierarchy & Responsibilities

The project is structured as a Cargo workspace with the following key components:

### Core & Infrastructure
- **`daq-core`**: The foundation of the system. Defines common types, traits, capabilities, and data structures used across all other crates. It acts as the "common language" of the ecosystem.
- **`daq-proto`**: Defines the wire protocols (gRPC/Protobuf) for network communication. Dependencies on `tonic` and `prost`.
- **`daq-bin`**: The application entry point. Contains the main binary (`rust_daq`) and acts as the composition root, wiring together the other crates based on compile-time features.

### Functionality Modules
- **`daq-hardware`**: Implements the hardware abstraction layer (HAL). It uses a **capability-based** model where devices expose capabilities (e.g., `Move`, `Detect`) rather than concrete types. Contains drivers for specific hardware (Thorlabs, Newport, PVCAM, etc.) managed via feature flags.
- **`daq-experiment`**: The orchestration engine. Implements a **RunEngine** inspired by the Bluesky library. It executes declarative **Plans** and generates a stream of **Documents** (Start, Descriptor, Event, Stop).
- **`daq-storage`**: Handles data persistence. Supports multiple backends including CSV, HDF5, and Arrow, abstracting the physical storage format from the experiment logic.
- **`daq-scripting`**: Provides scripting capabilities (Python, Rhai) to allow users to define experiments and control hardware dynamically.
- **`daq-server`**: Exposes the system functionality over the network using gRPC (`tonic`). Supports web clients via `tonic-web`.

### The Integrator
- **`rust-daq`**: The "glue" library. It integrates the core modules and provides high-level application logic. It currently also houses the GUI code (`egui`), making it a heavy dependency.

### Data Flow: Experiment Execution

The system follows a pipeline architecture for experiment data:

1.  **Plan**: A user or script submits a declarative plan (e.g., "Scan X from 0 to 10").
2.  **RunEngine**: The `daq-experiment` engine accepts the plan.
3.  **Hardware**: The engine commands devices via `daq-hardware`.
4.  **Documents**: As data is acquired, the engine emits a stream of structured **Documents**.
5.  **Dispatch**: Documents are sent to storage (local/remote) and the network (for live visualization).

    participant Client as GUI/Network

        HW-->>Engine: Status/Data

        par Dispatch
            Engine->>Store: Write Document
            Engine->>Client: Stream Document (gRPC)
        end
    end
```

## Key Architectural Patterns

1.  **Capability-Based HAL**: Hardware is not represented by inheritance hierarchies but by what it *can do* (Capabilities). This allows for flexible composition and easier mocking.
2.  **Bluesky-like Orchestration**: Separation of *what* to do (Plan) from *how* to do it (RunEngine). This enables features like pause/resume, error recovery, and complex scanning logic without tightly coupling to specific hardware.
3.  **Document-Oriented Data Model**: Data is treated as a stream of self-describing documents (Start -> Descriptor -> Events... -> Stop). This schema-less approach adapts well to varied experiments.
4.  **Workspace Composition**: Usage of Cargo workspace to enforce modularity, though `rust-daq` remains a large central integrator.

## Code Smells & Recommendations

1.  **The `rust-daq` Monolith**:
    - **Smell**: The `rust-daq` crate acts as both a library integrator and the home for the GUI. This makes it a very heavy dependency.
    - **Recommendation**: Split the GUI code into a dedicated `daq-gui` crate. `rust-daq` should strictly be the domain logic integrator or be dissolved if `daq-bin` can compose the modules directly.

2.  **Feature Flag Duplication**:
    - **Smell**: Hardware support features are defined in `daq-hardware` and mirrored/re-exported in `rust-daq` and `daq-server`. This requires keeping `Cargo.toml` files in sync and adds maintenance burden.
    - **Recommendation**: Centralize feature definitions or use a workspace-level tool to manage them. Consider if `rust-daq` needs to re-export all hardware features or if consumers should depend on `daq-hardware` directly for specific drivers.

3.  **Hub-and-Spoke Dependency**:
    - **Observation**: `daq-core` is a critical dependency. Any change in `daq-core` triggers a full rebuild of the ecosystem.
    - **Recommendation**: Keep `daq-core` minimal and stable. Ensure unstable or experimental types are kept in their respective leaf crates until mature.

4.  **"Kitchen Sink" Integration**:
    - **Smell**: `daq-bin` depends on `rust-daq` which pulls in almost everything. This makes `rust_daq` binary heavy.
    - **Recommendation**: Create specialized binaries (e.g., `daq-cli`, `daq-server-bin`, `daq-gui-bin`) that only pull in the crates they need, rather than a single `daq-bin` with many feature flags.
