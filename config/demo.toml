# Demo Hardware Configuration for rust-daq
#
# This configuration uses mock devices for demonstration and testing.
# No physical hardware required - perfect for trying out rust-daq!
#
# Usage:
#   rust-daq-daemon daemon --hardware-config config/demo.toml
#
# Or use programmatically:
#   cargo run --bin rust-daq-daemon -- daemon --hardware-config config/demo.toml

# About Mock Devices
# ============================================================================
#
# Mock devices simulate real hardware behavior without requiring physical
# equipment. They're perfect for:
#
# - Learning the rust-daq API
# - Testing scripts before deploying to hardware
# - Demonstrating capabilities to stakeholders
# - Developing features without hardware access
#
# Each mock device implements the same capability traits as real hardware:
#
# - mock_stage:       Movable (move_abs, move_rel, get_position)
# - mock_power_meter: Readable (read_value)
# - mock_camera:      FrameProducer, Triggerable, ExposureControl
#
# Scripts written for mock devices work identically with real hardware after
# updating the configuration.
