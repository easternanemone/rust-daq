//! Custom error types for the application.
//!
//! This module defines the primary error type, `DaqError`, for the entire application.
//! Using the `thiserror` crate, it provides a centralized and consistent way to handle
//! different kinds of errors that can occur, from I/O and configuration issues to
//! instrument-specific problems.
//!
//! ## Error Hierarchy
//!
//! `DaqError` is an enum that consolidates various error sources:
//!
//! - **`Config`**: Wraps errors from the `config` crate, typically related to file parsing
//!   or format issues in the configuration files.
//! - **`Configuration`**: Represents semantic errors in the configuration, such as invalid
//!   values that pass parsing but are logically incorrect (e.g., an invalid IP address format).
//!   These are usually caught during the validation step.
//! - **`Io`**: Wraps standard `std::io::Error`, covering all file and network I/O issues.
//! - **`Tokio`**: Specifically for errors related to the Tokio runtime, though it also wraps
//!   `std::io::Error` as Tokio I/O operations are a common source.
//! - **`Instrument`**: A general category for errors originating from instrument drivers. This
//!   could be anything from a communication failure to an invalid command sent to the hardware.
//! - **`Processing`**: For errors that occur during data processing stages, such as filtering
//!   or analysis.
//! - **`FeatureNotEnabled`**: A specific error used when the code attempts to use functionality
//!   (like a specific instrument driver or storage format) that was not included at compile
//!   time via feature flags. This provides a clear message to the user on how to enable it.
//!
//! By using `#[from]`, `DaqError` can be seamlessly created from underlying error types,
//! simplifying error handling throughout the application with the `?` operator.
