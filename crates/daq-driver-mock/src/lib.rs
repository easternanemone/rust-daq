//! Mock Hardware Drivers for rust-daq
//!
//! This crate provides simulated hardware devices for testing without physical hardware.
//! All mock devices use async-safe operations (tokio::time::sleep, not std::thread::sleep).
//!
//! # Available Mock Drivers
//!
//! - [`MockStage`] - Simulated motion stage with realistic timing
//! - [`MockCamera`] - Simulated camera with trigger and streaming support
//! - [`MockPowerMeter`] - Simulated power meter with configurable readings
//! - [`MockLaser`] - Simulated tunable laser (MaiTai-like) with wavelength tuning and safety interlocks
//! - [`MockRotator`] - Simulated rotary stage (ELL14-like) with velocity control
//! - [`MockDAQOutput`] - Simulated analog output with voltage range validation
//!
//! # Performance Characteristics
//!
//! - MockStage: 10mm/sec motion speed, 50ms settling time
//! - MockCamera: 33ms frame readout (~30fps simulation)
//! - MockPowerMeter: ~1% noise on readings
//! - MockLaser: 30s warmup, 690-1040nm tuning range, shutter-emission interlock
//! - MockRotator: 0-360° range, velocity-dependent motion timing
//! - MockDAQOutput: ±10V / ±5V / 0-10V / 0-5V ranges
//!
//! # Driver Factory Pattern
//!
//! Each mock driver provides a `DriverFactory` implementation for use with
//! the daq-hardware registry:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use daq_driver_mock::{MockStageFactory, MockCameraFactory, MockPowerMeterFactory};
//! use daq_hardware::DeviceRegistry;
//!
//! let registry = DeviceRegistry::new();
//! registry.register_factory(Box::new(MockStageFactory));
//! registry.register_factory(Box::new(MockCameraFactory));
//! registry.register_factory(Box::new(MockPowerMeterFactory));
//! registry.register_factory(Box::new(MockLaserFactory));
//! registry.register_factory(Box::new(MockRotatorFactory));
//! registry.register_factory(Box::new(MockDAQOutputFactory));
//! ```
