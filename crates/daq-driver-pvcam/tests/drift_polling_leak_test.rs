//! Reproduction test for PVCAM drift polling resource leak (bd-qtd4)
//!
//! This test verifies that the drift polling background task properly exits when
//! the driver is dropped, allowing the SDK to be uninitialized.
//!
//! ## The Bug
//!
//! The drift polling task (lines 652-701 in lib.rs) captures a strong Arc to the
//! PvcamConnection, creating a reference cycle:
//!
//! 1. Task spawned with `connection.clone()` (strong Arc)
//! 2. Task runs in infinite loop with no exit condition
//! 3. Strong Arc prevents PvcamConnection from dropping
//! 4. SDK never uninitialized (pl_pvcam_uninit not called)
//!
//! ## Expected Behavior
//!
//! **Before fix (this test should FAIL):**
//! - SDK ref count stays at 1 after driver dropped
//! - Multiple driver creations increment ref count without decrement
//! - Second driver creation may fail or exhibit undefined behavior
//!
//! **After fix (this test should PASS):**
//! - SDK ref count returns to 0 after driver dropped
//! - Multiple driver creations work correctly
//! - Clean shutdown with proper SDK uninitialization
//!
//! ## Running
//!
//! ```bash
//! # Mock mode (safe to run locally)
//! cargo test -p daq-driver-pvcam --test drift_polling_leak_test
//!
//! # With hardware (on maitai)
//! cargo test -p daq-driver-pvcam --test drift_polling_leak_test --features pvcam_hardware
//! ```
