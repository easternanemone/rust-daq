# PVCAM Driver Validation Checklist

## Summary

**Status**: VALIDATED
**Date**: 2025-12-07
**Camera**: Photometrics Prime BSI (2048x2048)
**SDK**: PVCAM 3.10.2.5
**Test Suite**: 61 hardware tests
**Result**: ALL TESTS PASSING

## V5 Reactive Parameter System

The PVCAM driver now implements the V5 `Parameter<T>` reactive system. All camera state is exposed as observable parameters accessible via gRPC.

### Registered Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Unit |
|-----------|------|-------------|------|
| `exposure_ms` | `f64` | Exposure time | ms |
| `roi` | `Roi` | Region of interest | pixels |
| `binning` | `(u16, u16)` | Binning factors (x, y) | - |
| `armed` | `bool` | Trigger armed state | - |
| `streaming` | `bool` | Continuous streaming active | - |
| `temperature` | `f64` | Current sensor temperature (read-only) | °C |
| `temperature_setpoint` | `f64` | Target cooling temperature | °C |
| `fan_speed` | `String` | Fan speed (High/Medium/Low/Off) | - |
| `gain_index` | `u16` | Current gain mode index | - |
| `speed_index` | `u16` | Current speed/readout mode index | - |

Hardware get/set methods automatically sync with parameters, enabling real-time gRPC observation.

## Mock Test Results (No Hardware)

All 19 mock tests pass, validating:
- Camera dimension configuration (Prime BSI: 2048x2048, Prime 95B: 1200x1200)
- Binning validation (1, 2, 4, 8 accepted; 3, 5, 6, 7, 16 rejected)
- ROI bounds checking
- Frame size calculation with binning
- Exposure control
- Trigger arm/disarm
- Multiple frame acquisition
- Rapid acquisition rate (>10 fps in mock mode)

## Environment Setup (Required for Hardware Tests)

```bash
# Source PVCAM environment
source /opt/pvcam/etc/profile.d/pvcam.sh

# Set SDK directory
export PVCAM_SDK_DIR=/opt/pvcam/sdk

# Set library paths
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/pvcam/library/x86_64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/pvcam/library/x86_64:$LIBRARY_PATH
```

## Running Tests

### Mock Tests (No Hardware)
```bash
cargo test --features instrument_photometrics --test hardware_pvcam_validation
```

### Hardware Tests (Requires Prime BSI)
```bash
cargo test --test hardware_pvcam_validation \
  --features 'instrument_photometrics,pvcam_hardware,hardware_tests' \
  -- --test-threads=1 --nocapture
```

### gRPC Real-World Harness (End-to-End Streaming)
```bash
RUST_LOG=info,daq_pvcam=debug,daq_server=info \
  cargo run --release -p rust-daq --bin pvcam_grpc_harness \
    --features 'server,instrument_photometrics,pvcam_hardware' -- \
    --scenario baseline \
    --duration-secs 1800 \
    --output /tmp/pvcam_grpc_harness_summary.json
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Speed Table Name**: PARAM_SPDTAB_NAME not available on Prime BSI (returns PL_ERR_PARAMETER_NOT_AVAILABLE). This is expected per Photometrics documentation.

2. **Smart Streaming Exposure Count**: Query returns buffer size error. Exposure sequence setting works; count query has API limitation.

3. **Prime 95B Tests**: Not validated (no hardware available). Mock tests for 1200x1200 sensor dimensions pass.

## Validation Sign-off

| Validator | Date | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Claude Code | 2025-11-26 | Full hardware validation completed |

## CI/CD Integration

### Smoke Test

A minimal smoke test is configured in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` under the `hardware-tests` job.

**Running Manually:**
```bash
export PVCAM_SDK_DIR=/opt/pvcam/sdk
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/pvcam/library/x86_64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/pvcam/library/x86_64:$LIBRARY_PATH
export PVCAM_SMOKE_TEST=1
export PVCAM_CAMERA_NAME=PrimeBSI

cargo test --test pvcam_hardware_smoke \
  --features 'instrument_photometrics,pvcam_hardware' \
  -- --nocapture
```

**Test Coverage:**
- SDK initialization
- Camera enumeration and detection
- Camera connection
- Exposure configuration
- Single frame acquisition
- Frame data validation
- Proper cleanup

## Next Steps

- Validate with Prime 95B when hardware available.
- Test continuous streaming performance over extended periods.
- Measure actual frame rates in production configuration.
- Test with different triggering modes (external hardware trigger).
- gRPC real-world scenario specification: `crates/rust-daq/docs/reference/instruments/PVCAM_GRPC_REAL_WORLD_SCENARIO.md`.
