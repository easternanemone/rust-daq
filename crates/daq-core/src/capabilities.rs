//! Atomic Hardware Capabilities
//!
//! This module defines fine-grained capability traits that hardware devices can implement.
//! Instead of monolithic traits like `Camera` or `Instrument`, devices implement
//! specific capabilities they actually support:
//!
//! - A camera might implement: `Triggerable + ExposureControl + FrameProducer`
//! - A stage might implement: `Movable + Triggerable`
//! - A power meter might implement: `Readable`
//!
//! This approach enables:
//! - Better composition (devices can mix capabilities)
//! - Clearer contracts (traits are small and focused)
//! - Easier testing (mock individual capabilities)
//! - Hardware-agnostic code (functions work with trait bounds)
//!
//! # Design Philosophy
//!
//! Each capability trait:
//! - Is async (uses #[async_trait])
//! - Is thread-safe (requires Send + Sync)
//! - Uses anyhow::Result for errors
//! - Focuses on ONE thing
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! // A triggered camera implements multiple capabilities
//! struct SimulatedCamera {
//!     exposure_ms: f64,
//!     armed: bool,
//!     frame_count: u32,
//! }
//!
//! #[async_trait]
//! impl ExposureControl for SimulatedCamera {
//!     async fn set_exposure(&self, seconds: f64) -> Result<()> {
//!         self.exposure_ms = seconds * 1000.0;
//!         Ok(())
//!     }
//!
//!     async fn get_exposure(&self) -> Result<f64> {
//!         Ok(self.exposure_ms / 1000.0)
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! #[async_trait]
//! impl Triggerable for SimulatedCamera {
//!     async fn arm(&self) -> Result<()> {
//!         self.armed = true;
//!         Ok(())
//!     }
//!
//!     async fn trigger(&self) -> Result<()> {
//!         if !self.armed {
//!             anyhow::bail!("Camera not armed");
//!         }
//!         // Capture frame...
//!         Ok(())
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! #[async_trait]
//! impl FrameProducer for SimulatedCamera {
//!     async fn start_stream(&self) -> Result<()> { Ok(()) }
//!     async fn stop_stream(&self) -> Result<()> { Ok(()) }
//!     fn resolution(&self) -> (u32, u32) { (1024, 1024) }
//! }
//!
//! // Use in generic code
//! async fn triggered_acquisition<T>(device: &T) -> Result<()>
//! where
//!     T: Triggerable + ExposureControl + FrameProducer
//! {
//!     device.set_exposure(0.1).await?;
//!     device.arm().await?;
//!     device.trigger().await?;
//!     Ok(())

/// Capability: Parameter Registry Access
///
/// Devices that expose their parameters for introspection and control.
///
/// This trait enables generic code (gRPC, presets, HDF5 writers) to:
/// - List all parameters of a device
/// - Subscribe to parameter changes
/// - Snapshot device state for reproducibility
///
/// # Contract
/// - `parameters()` returns a reference to the device's parameter registry
/// - The ParameterSet should contain all mutable device parameters
/// - Parameters must use Parameter<T> for hardware-backed state
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// impl Parameterized for MockCamera {
///     fn parameters(&self) -> &ParameterSet {
///         &self.params
///     }
/// }
///
/// // Generic code can now enumerate parameters
/// fn list_all_parameters<D: Parameterized>(device: &D) {
///     for name in device.parameters().names() {
///         println!("Parameter: {}", name);
///     }
/// }
/// ```

// Example: Triggered Camera
//
// A camera that supports external triggering would implement:
// ```rust,ignore
// struct TriggeredCamera { /* ... */ }
//
// impl Triggerable for TriggeredCamera { /* ... */ }
// impl ExposureControl for TriggeredCamera { /* ... */ }
// impl FrameProducer for TriggeredCamera { /* ... */ }
//
// // Use in generic scan code
// async fn scan_with_camera<C>(camera: &C) -> Result<()>
// where
//     C: Triggerable + ExposureControl + FrameProducer
// {
//     camera.set_exposure(0.1).await?;
//     camera.arm().await?;
//     camera.trigger().await?;
//     Ok(())
