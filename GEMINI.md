# GEMINI.md

## Project Overview

This project contains the documentation for a scientific data acquisition (DAQ) application built with Rust. The application is designed to be a high-performance, modular, and reliable alternative to Python-based solutions like PyMoDAQ, ScopeFoundry, or Qudi.

The core architectural principles are:
*   **Modular Plugin System:** Instruments, GUIs, and data processors are designed as separate, dynamically loadable modules using a trait-based interface.
*   **Async-First Design:** The application is built on the Tokio runtime, using async-first principles and channel-based communication for non-blocking operations.
*   **Type Safety and Reliability:** Leverages Rust's strong type system and `Result`-based error handling to ensure safety and reliability.

The technology stack includes:
*   **Core:** Rust
*   **Asynchronous Runtime:** Tokio
*   **GUI:** egui
*   **Data Handling:** ndarray, polars, serde, HDF5
*   **Instrument Control:** scpi, serialport

## Building and Running

The following commands are based on the provided documentation for building, running, and testing the application.

### Running the Application

```bash
# Run in development mode with hot-reloading
cargo watch -x run

# Run in release mode
cargo run --release

# Run with specific features (e.g., HDF5 support)
cargo run --features hdf5-support
```

### Testing the Application

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run a specific test
cargo test test_instrument_initialization

# Run integration tests
cargo test --test integration
```

## Development Conventions

*   **Code Formatting:** Use `cargo fmt` to format the code.
*   **Linting:** Use `cargo clippy` to check for common issues.
*   **Dependency Auditing:** Use `cargo audit` to check for security vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   **Error Handling:** The project uses the `thiserror` crate for custom error types.
*   **Testing:** The project follows a comprehensive testing strategy, including unit tests with mock instruments, integration tests for data flow, and performance tests.
