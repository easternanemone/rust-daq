# Phase 02 Plan 04: JSON Serialization and Validation Display Summary

**One-liner:** Added file save/load with native dialogs and validation error display in status bar and property inspector.

## What Was Built

1. **JSON Serialization:**
   - `GraphFile` struct wraps graph data with version and metadata
   - `GraphMetadata` stores name, description, author, timestamps
   - `save_graph()` / `load_graph()` functions with error handling
   - Version checking for future compatibility
   - `.expgraph` file extension for experiment graphs

2. **File Operations UI:**
   - Toolbar buttons: New, Open..., Save, Save As...
   - Native file dialogs via `rfd` crate
   - Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+S (save), Ctrl+O (open)
   - Current file name displayed in toolbar
   - Auto-fading status messages for save/load feedback

3. **Validation Error Display:**
   - `node_errors` HashMap in ExperimentViewer
   - Bottom status bar shows error count and summary
   - Property inspector shows detailed error for selected node
   - Color coding: red for errors, green for "Graph valid"
   - Validation runs on: load, property change, node add/remove

## Technical Decisions

**File Extension (.expgraph):**
Using a distinct extension rather than generic `.json` helps users identify experiment files and enables proper file associations.

**Validation Location:**
Chose status bar + property inspector over inline node decoration. This avoids egui-snarl API complexity while providing clear feedback.

**Status Message Auto-fade:**
Messages auto-clear after 3 seconds using `Instant::elapsed()` check. Keeps UI clean without requiring manual dismiss.

## Deviations from Plan

None significant. Implementation followed plan closely.

## Human Verification Results

**Verified by user on 2026-01-22:**

- ✓ Node creation via context menu works
- ✓ Wire connections between nodes work
- ✓ Property editing in inspector works
- ✓ Undo/redo with Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y works
- ✓ Save As... creates valid .expgraph file
- ✓ New clears graph, Open... restores saved state
- ✓ Validation errors appear for empty actuator field
- ✓ "Graph valid" shows when validation passes

## Files Changed

**Created (1 file):**
- `crates/daq-egui/src/graph/serialization.rs` (65 lines) - GraphFile, save/load functions

**Modified (4 files):**
- `crates/daq-egui/Cargo.toml` (+2 deps) - rfd, chrono
- `crates/daq-egui/src/graph/mod.rs` (+2 lines) - serialization export
- `crates/daq-egui/src/graph/viewer.rs` (+25 lines) - node_errors, error methods
- `crates/daq-egui/src/panels/experiment_designer.rs` (+120 lines) - file ops, validation display

## Commits

- `f4d69beb` - feat(02-04): implement JSON serialization for graph save/load
- `86be95a4` - feat(02-04): add Save/Load UI with file dialogs
- `c666d385` - feat(02-04): add validation error display in status bar and inspector

## Phase 02 Completion

This plan completes Phase 02: Node Graph Editor Core.

**All success criteria met:**
1. ✓ User can drag node from palette onto canvas and connect nodes with wires
2. ✓ User can configure node parameters via property inspector panel
3. ✓ User can undo/redo edits with Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y, with full edit history
4. ✓ Editor shows validation errors visually (status bar, property inspector) when nodes invalid

**Note:** EDIT-03 (subgraph grouping) was deferred to Phase 9 as documented in ROADMAP.md.
