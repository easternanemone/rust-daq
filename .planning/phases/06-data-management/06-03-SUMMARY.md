phase: 06-data-management
plan: 03
subsystem: storage
tags: [hdf5, annotation, metadata, gui, async]

# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 06-02
    provides: Run history browser UI and gRPC list_acquisitions endpoint
provides:
  - HDF5 annotation utilities (add_run_annotation, read_run_annotations)
  - RunAnnotation struct for user notes and tags
  - Annotation editor UI in RunHistoryPanel detail view
  - Async spawn_blocking handlers for HDF5 file I/O
affects: [06-04]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - HDF5 attributes for post-acquisition metadata
    - spawn_blocking for blocking file I/O in async context
    - Feature-gated storage functionality

key-files:
  created:
    - crates/daq-storage/src/hdf5_annotation.rs
  modified:
    - crates/daq-storage/src/lib.rs
    - crates/daq-egui/src/panels/run_history.rs
    - crates/daq-egui/Cargo.toml

key-decisions:
  - "Tags stored as JSON array in HDF5 attributes for structured filtering"
  - "Annotation timestamp (annotated_at_ns) records when metadata was added"
  - "Comma-separated tags UI for simplicity (MVP pattern from 06-01)"

patterns-established:
  - "HDF5 attribute deletion before writing (no overwrite API available)"
  - "VarLenUnicode type for string attributes with .parse::<VarLenUnicode>()"
  - "Auto-load annotations on selection change in detail view"

# Phase 06 Plan 03: Run Annotation Summary

**User notes and tags persist to HDF5 attributes via async file I/O with spawn_blocking pattern**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 7 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-23T02:06:59Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-23T02:13:51Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments
- Users can add notes and tags to completed runs via RunHistoryPanel detail view
- Annotations persist to HDF5 /start group as user_notes and tags attributes
- Existing annotations auto-load when run is selected in history table
- Feature-gated with storage_hdf5 flag for optional HDF5 support

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create HDF5 annotation utilities module** - `aaa67638` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Add annotation UI to RunHistoryPanel detail view** - `7e7748ee` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Implement async save/load annotation handlers** - `fe4bf180` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `crates/daq-storage/src/hdf5_annotation.rs` - RunAnnotation struct and HDF5 attribute utilities
- `crates/daq-storage/src/lib.rs` - Export hdf5_annotation module (feature-gated)
- `crates/daq-egui/src/panels/run_history.rs` - Annotation editor in detail view with async handlers
- `crates/daq-egui/Cargo.toml` - Added daq-storage dependency for annotation types

## Decisions Made

**1. Tags as JSON array in HDF5 attributes**
- Rationale: Structured format enables future filtering/querying without text parsing
- Alternative considered: Comma-separated string - rejected for lack of type safety

**2. annotated_at_ns timestamp attribute**
- Rationale: Track when metadata was added (different from acquisition created_at_ns)
- Use case: Distinguish between immediate notes vs. retrospective analysis

**3. Comma-separated tags UI pattern**
- Rationale: Matches metadata capture UI from 06-01 (consistency)
- Future enhancement: Autocomplete tag selector with existing tags

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Fixed HDF5 API usage for attribute deletion**
- **Found during:** Task 1 (Building hdf5_annotation module)
- **Issue:** `Attribute::delete()` method doesn't exist - used wrong API
- **Fix:** Changed to `Group::delete_attr(name)` on parent group
- **Files modified:** crates/daq-storage/src/hdf5_annotation.rs
- **Verification:** cargo build -p daq-storage --features storage_hdf5 passed
- **Committed in:** aaa67638 (Task 1 commit)

**2. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Added VarLenUnicode type annotation to parse() calls**
- **Found during:** Task 1 (Building hdf5_annotation module)
- **Issue:** `.parse()` without type parameter caused "trait bound () : FromStr" error
- **Fix:** Changed to `.parse::<VarLenUnicode>()` (pattern from document_writer.rs)
- **Files modified:** crates/daq-storage/src/hdf5_annotation.rs
- **Verification:** cargo build succeeded after fix
- **Committed in:** aaa67638 (Task 1 commit)

**3. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Added daq-storage dependency to daq-egui**
- **Found during:** Task 2 (Building annotation UI)
- **Issue:** RunAnnotation type not available in daq-egui scope
- **Fix:** Added daq-storage as optional dependency with storage_hdf5 feature propagation
- **Files modified:** crates/daq-egui/Cargo.toml
- **Verification:** cargo build -p daq-egui --features storage_hdf5 succeeded
- **Committed in:** 7e7748ee (Task 2 commit)

---

**Total deviations:** 3 auto-fixed (3 blocking)
**Impact on plan:** All auto-fixes were API corrections and dependency resolution. No functional scope changes.

## Issues Encountered

**HDF5 API documentation gap:**
- hdf5-metno crate documentation is minimal for attribute manipulation
- Resolution: Referenced existing code in document_writer.rs for VarLenUnicode pattern
- Future: Consider contributing API examples to hdf5-metno docs

## Next Phase Readiness

**Ready for 06-04 (Run Comparison Viewer):**
- Annotation metadata is available via read_run_annotations() API
- HDF5 files are properly structured with /start group attributes
- GUI pattern established for loading HDF5 metadata in panels

**No blockers.**
