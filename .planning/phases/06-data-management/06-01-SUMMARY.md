# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 01-form-based-scan-builder
    provides: ScanBuilderPanel with queue_plan integration
  - phase: 05-live-visualization
    provides: ExperimentDesignerPanel with execution controls
provides:
  - MetadataEditor widget for capturing experiment metadata
  - User can enter sample ID, operator, purpose, notes before running experiments
  - Extensible key-value custom fields for domain-specific metadata
  - Metadata flows through QueuePlanRequest to StartDoc and HDF5 storage
  - Auto-added provenance metadata (scan_type, actuator, detector, graph info)
affects: [06-02-run-history, 06-03-run-comparison, hdf5-persistence]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - Reusable metadata editor widget with extensible fields
    - Auto-enrichment pattern (user metadata + system provenance)
    - Collapsible optional metadata sections in experiment panels

key-decisions:
  - "Comma-separated tags field instead of structured tag selector (simplicity for Phase 1)"
  - "Empty metadata fields allowed (all optional) to avoid friction"
  - "Auto-add provenance metadata from UI context (scan_type, device IDs) for traceability"
  - "Metadata passed through existing queue_plan() infrastructure (no protocol changes)"

patterns-established:
  - "MetadataEditor.to_metadata_map() converts UI state to HashMap<String, String> for protocol"
  - "Tags serialized as JSON array for structured filtering in future phases"
  - "Auto-enrichment before queueing: merge user metadata with system provenance"

# Phase 6 Plan 1: Metadata Capture Summary

**MetadataEditor widget with extensible key-value fields integrated into ScanBuilderPanel and ExperimentDesignerPanel, enriching StartDoc with user metadata and auto-added provenance for HDF5 persistence**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 11 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-23T05:51:27Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-23T06:02:17Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 6

## Accomplishments
- MetadataEditor widget created with common fields (sample_id, operator, purpose, notes) and extensible custom fields
- ScanBuilderPanel shows collapsible metadata section, passes metadata to queue_plan with scan provenance
- ExperimentDesignerPanel shows metadata section, prepared for future graph plan queueing with graph provenance
- Metadata enrichment pattern established: user fields + auto-added system context

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create MetadataEditor widget** - `dc7d0378` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Integrate into ScanBuilderPanel** - `188fa9de` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Integrate into ExperimentDesignerPanel** - `f23e977d` (feat)

**Blocking fixes:** `5856a020` (fix: compilation errors in run_history and mock_camera)

## Files Created/Modified
- `crates/daq-egui/src/widgets/metadata_editor.rs` - MetadataEditor widget with ui(), to_metadata_map(), is_empty()
- `crates/daq-egui/src/widgets/mod.rs` - Export MetadataEditor
- `crates/daq-egui/src/panels/scan_builder.rs` - Metadata editor field, collapsible UI section, enrichment with scan provenance
- `crates/daq-egui/src/panels/experiment_designer.rs` - Metadata editor field, collapsible UI section, enrichment with graph provenance
- `crates/daq-egui/src/panels/run_history.rs` - Fixed plan_type field references (field doesn't exist in proto)
- `crates/daq-driver-mock/src/mock_camera.rs` - Fixed clippy warnings (type_complexity, is_multiple_of)

## Decisions Made
- **Comma-separated tags:** Simple string input instead of structured tag selector - easier to use, can migrate to autocomplete in Phase 2
- **All fields optional:** No required metadata to avoid workflow friction - users can run experiments without filling in metadata
- **Auto-enrichment pattern:** UI panels add system context (scan_type, device IDs, graph info) before queueing - provides traceability without user effort
- **JSON array for tags:** Serialized as `["tag1", "tag2"]` instead of plain string - enables structured filtering in run history (Phase 6-02)

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Fixed missing plan_type field in run_history.rs**
- **Found during:** Task 1 (initial build)
- **Issue:** run_history.rs referenced AcquisitionSummary.plan_type field which doesn't exist in proto definition
- **Fix:** Commented out plan_type references, added TODO to add field to proto in future
- **Files modified:** crates/daq-egui/src/panels/run_history.rs
- **Verification:** Build succeeds
- **Committed in:** 5856a020 (separate commit before Task 1)

**2. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Fixed egui API change for clipboard**
- **Found during:** Task 1 (initial build)
- **Issue:** run_history.rs used deprecated `output.copied_text` API instead of `ctx().copy_text()`
- **Fix:** Updated to use `ui.ctx().copy_text()` (current egui API)
- **Files modified:** crates/daq-egui/src/panels/run_history.rs
- **Verification:** Build succeeds
- **Committed in:** 5856a020 (same commit as issue #1)

**3. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Fixed clippy warnings in mock_camera.rs**
- **Found during:** Task 1 (clippy check)
- **Issue:** Clippy errors blocking build with `-D warnings` flag
- **Fix:** Added `#[allow(clippy::type_complexity)]` annotation, replaced `% 100 == 0` with `is_multiple_of(100)`
- **Files modified:** crates/daq-driver-mock/src/mock_camera.rs
- **Verification:** Clippy passes
- **Committed in:** 5856a020 (same commit as issues #1-2)

---

**Total deviations:** 3 auto-fixed (all Rule 3 - Blocking)
**Impact on plan:** All fixes were pre-existing compilation/clippy errors blocking build. No scope creep - purely unblocking existing code.

## Issues Encountered
None - plan executed smoothly after blocking fixes

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- MetadataEditor widget complete and integrated
- Metadata flows through queue_plan to server (StartDoc enrichment on server side)
- Ready for Phase 06-02 (run history browser) which will display metadata from acquisitions
- Ready for Phase 06-03 (run comparison) which will use tags for filtering

**Blockers/Concerns:**
- ExperimentDesignerPanel doesn't actually queue plans yet (TODO at line 878) - metadata prepared but not sent
- AcquisitionSummary proto missing plan_type field - should be added for run history filtering
