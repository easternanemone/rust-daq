# Phase 4: Sequences and Control Flow Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Scientists can compose multi-step sequences with moves, waits, acquire, and loops

**Verified:** 2026-01-22T18:00:00Z

**Status:** passed

**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | User can add move command node (absolute/relative position) to sequence | ✓ VERIFIED | Move node in NodePalette, MoveConfig with mode toggle, property inspector shows Absolute/Relative radio, position field, wait_settled checkbox |
| 2 | User can add wait/delay node with configurable duration for settling time | ✓ VERIFIED | Wait node in NodePalette, WaitCondition enum with Duration variant, property inspector shows wait type selector and duration field |
| 3 | User can add acquire node to trigger detector data capture | ✓ VERIFIED | Acquire node in NodePalette, AcquireConfig with detector/exposure/frame_count, property inspector shows all controls with burst mode support |
| 4 | User can create loop node to repeat sequence N times or until condition met | ✓ VERIFIED | Loop node in NodePalette, LoopConfig with LoopTermination enum (Count/Condition/Infinite), loop body detection and unrolling implemented |

**Score:** 4/4 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |

| `crates/daq-egui/src/widgets/property_inspector.rs` | Full property inspectors for all node types | ✓ VERIFIED | 495 lines, show_move_inspector (lines 61-106), show_wait_inspector (194-340), show_acquire_inspector (142-191), show_loop_inspector (343-495) all substantive with complete UI controls |
| `crates/daq-egui/src/widgets/node_palette.rs` | Move, Wait, Acquire, Loop in palette | ✓ VERIFIED | All 4 node types in NodeType::all(), create_node() method maps to default constructors |
| `crates/daq-egui/src/graph/translation.rs` | Loop body detection and unrolling | ✓ VERIFIED | find_loop_body_nodes() at line 387, Loop translation with unrolling at line 325-373, handles Count/Condition/Infinite variants |
| `crates/daq-egui/src/graph/validation.rs` | Loop body validation | ✓ VERIFIED | validate_loop_body() at line 147, warn_relative_moves_in_loop() at line 181, find_ancestors() for back-edge detection |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|----|--------|---------|
| NodePalette | ExperimentNode | create_node() method | ✓ WIRED | node_palette.rs:66-69 calls default_move/wait/acquire/loop, creates instances |
| PropertyInspector | MoveConfig | show_move_inspector | ✓ WIRED | property_inspector.rs:61-106 edits config fields, returns changed flag |
| PropertyInspector | DeviceSelector | device field editing | ✓ WIRED | All inspectors use DeviceSelector::new + show() for device fields (lines 75-80, 155-160, 419-425) |
| ExperimentDesignerPanel | PropertyInspector | sidebar rendering | ✓ WIRED | experiment_designer.rs:285 passes device_ids to PropertyInspector::show() |
| GraphPlan translation | Loop body nodes | find_loop_body_nodes + unrolling | ✓ WIRED | translation.rs:329 calls find_loop_body_nodes, 352-372 unrolls iterations, 361 calls translate_node_with_snarl for each body node |
| Loop body validation | Back-edge detection | validate_loop_bodies | ✓ WIRED | validation.rs:210 validates loop body, 215 warns on relative moves, called from public API |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status | Blocking Issue |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| SEQ-01: Move commands (absolute/relative) | ✓ SATISFIED | None - MoveConfig with mode toggle, property inspector UI, translation to MoveTo command |
| SEQ-02: Wait/delay steps (duration) | ✓ SATISFIED | None - WaitCondition::Duration variant, property inspector with milliseconds field, translation to Wait command |
| SEQ-03: Acquire commands (detector capture) | ✓ SATISFIED | None - AcquireConfig with burst mode, property inspector with exposure override and frame count, translation to Trigger+Read loop |
| SEQ-04: Loops (count/condition/infinite) | ✓ SATISFIED | None - LoopConfig with LoopTermination variants, property inspector with type selector, loop body detection and unrolling, validation for back-edges |

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| translation.rs | 293 | TODO comment "Add WaitSettled command" | ⚠️ Warning | Move node wait_settled flag creates checkpoint but not full settle wait |
| translation.rs | 310 | TODO comment "Implement threshold-based waits" | ⚠️ Warning | Threshold/Stability waits fall back to timeout duration with warning log |

**Anti-pattern assessment:** Both TODOs are documented limitations, not blockers. Duration-based waits work fully. Threshold/Stability waits have graceful fallback. Wait_settled creates checkpoint for tracking (can be enhanced later).

### Human Verification Required

Manual GUI testing recommended for complete verification:

#### 1. Node Creation and Editing

**Test:** Open GUI, drag Move node from palette to canvas, select node, edit properties in inspector

**Expected:** 
- Move node appears in palette sidebar with orange color
- Drag creates node on canvas
- Property inspector shows: device selector, Absolute/Relative radio, position field, wait_settled checkbox
- Changing mode changes label from "Position:" to "Distance:"
- Changes are reflected immediately

**Why human:** Visual layout, drag interaction, label updates cannot be verified programmatically

#### 2. Wait Node Type Switching

**Test:** Add Wait node, select it, change wait type from Duration to Threshold to Stability in ComboBox

**Expected:**
- ComboBox shows current type (Duration by default)
- Changing type recreates variant with new default fields
- Duration: shows milliseconds field
- Threshold: shows device selector, operator dropdown, value field, timeout
- Stability: shows device selector, tolerance, duration_ms, timeout fields

**Why human:** ComboBox interaction, field visibility changes based on selection

#### 3. Loop Body Visualization

**Test:** Add Loop node, connect its "L" (body) output to an Acquire node, connect Loop's ">" (next) output to another node

**Expected:**
- Loop node shows 2 output pins: ">" (next) and "L" (body)
- Body output connects to nodes that repeat
- Next output connects to nodes after loop completes
- Validation warns if body connects back to loop or ancestor

**Why human:** Visual output pin differentiation, wire routing, validation message display

#### 4. Burst Acquisition Configuration

**Test:** Add Acquire node, set frame_count to 10, optionally enable exposure override

**Expected:**
- Frame count drag value allows 1-1000 range
- Exposure override checkbox toggles between "use device default" and drag value
- Translation generates 10 Trigger+Read pairs

**Why human:** Range validation UI, optional field interaction (this can be verified by examining translation output after execution)

## Gaps Summary

**No gaps found.** All 4 success criteria verified. All required artifacts substantive and wired correctly.

**Minor enhancements deferred (not blockers):**
1. WaitSettled command for Move nodes (currently creates checkpoint)
2. Threshold/Stability wait runtime evaluation (fallback to timeout works)
3. Device list async fetch in ExperimentDesignerPanel (TODO at line 285, empty list triggers text field fallback)
