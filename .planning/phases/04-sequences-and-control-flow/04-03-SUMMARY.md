    provides: LoopConfig with LoopTermination enum (Count, Condition, Infinite)
provides:
  - Loop body sub-graph detection via body output (pin 1) traversal
  - Loop body unrolling for count-based loops (N iterations)
  - Loop body validation (back-edge detection, relative move warnings)

# Phase 04 Plan 03: Loop Body Translation Summary

**Loop body unrolling with count-based iteration expansion and validation for back-edges and relative moves**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 4 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-22T13:36:25Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-22T13:41:21Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments
- Loop body sub-graphs correctly detected via body output (pin 1) BFS traversal
- Count-based loops unroll body N times with iteration checkpoints
- Loop body validation detects back-edges and warns on relative moves
- All existing tests pass (196 passed), 5 new tests added

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1-2: Loop body detection and unrolling** - `d90f3cbb` (feat)
   - Implemented find_loop_body_nodes() and is_loop_body_node()
   - Updated GraphPlan::from_snarl to skip body nodes in main traversal
   - Implemented loop body unrolling in translate_node_with_snarl
   - Added tests: test_loop_body_detection, test_loop_unrolling

2. **Task 3: Loop body validation** - `8873f232` (feat)
   - Implemented find_ancestors(), validate_loop_body(), warn_relative_moves_in_loop()
   - Added validate_loop_bodies() public API
   - Added tests: test_loop_backedge_detection, test_relative_move_warning, test_absolute_move_in_loop_ok

**Plan metadata:** (pending at plan completion)

## Files Created/Modified
- `crates/daq-egui/src/graph/translation.rs` - Loop body detection and unrolling logic
- `crates/daq-egui/src/graph/validation.rs` - Loop body validation (back-edges, relative moves)

## Decisions Made

1. **Loop body detection via BFS from output pin 1**
   - Rationale: Loop nodes have 2 outputs (0=Next, 1=Body). Body nodes are those reachable from pin 1 but NOT pin 0.

2. **Skip body nodes in main traversal**
   - Rationale: Body nodes are translated during loop unrolling. Main traversal must skip them to prevent double-translation.

3. **Condition-based loops use max_iterations as safety fallback**
   - Rationale: True condition evaluation requires RunEngine runtime support. Translation-time unrolling uses max_iterations with warning log.

4. **Relative moves in loop bodies generate warnings**
   - Rationale: Relative moves compound position each iteration (e.g., +10 → 10, 20, 30...). Users should be warned but not blocked (may be intentional).

5. **Back-edges from body to ancestors are errors**
   - Rationale: Loop body connecting back to loop input or ancestor creates infinite recursion. This is a structural error, not a warning.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - implementation proceeded smoothly. All tests passed on first run.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

**Ready for Phase 4 Plan 4 (execution integration):**
- Loop translation complete (unrolling + validation)
- GraphPlan can now handle Loop nodes with body sub-graphs
- Validation detects structural errors in loop bodies

**Known limitations:**
- Condition-based loops use max_iterations fallback (runtime condition evaluation deferred)
- Nested loops not yet tested (should work but needs explicit test coverage)

**Pre-existing issues:**
- test_version_check failure (noted in STATE.md, not introduced by this plan)
