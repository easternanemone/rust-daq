# Phase 7: Code Export and Provenance Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Complete provenance tracking with one-way code generation for inspection
**Verified:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No - initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | User sees live code preview pane showing generated Rhai script for current graph | VERIFIED | CodePreviewPanel renders in right SidePanel, updates via graph_version tracking |
| 2 | User can export experiment as standalone Rhai script file | VERIFIED | "Export Rhai..." button opens rfd::FileDialog, writes via std::fs::write |
| 3 | User can switch to script editor mode (eject from visual, edit code directly) | VERIFIED | "Eject to Script" button with confirmation dialog, ScriptEditorPanel with save/edit |
| 4 | Generated code is readable with comments explaining each step | VERIFIED | Each node generates `// Comment explaining step` before code block |
| 5 | Every experiment run captures complete provenance (graph version, git commit, device states) | VERIFIED | ExperimentManifest has git_commit, git_dirty, graph_hash, graph_file fields |

**Score:** 5/5 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `crates/daq-egui/src/graph/codegen.rs` | Rhai code generation | EXISTS (705 lines), SUBSTANTIVE, WIRED | Exports graph_to_rhai_script, imported in experiment_designer.rs |
| `crates/daq-core/build.rs` | Build-time git metadata capture | EXISTS (48 lines), SUBSTANTIVE | Emits VERGEN_GIT_SHA, VERGEN_GIT_DIRTY, VERGEN_GIT_COMMIT_DATE |
| `crates/daq-core/src/experiment/document.rs` | Extended ExperimentManifest | EXISTS (765 lines), SUBSTANTIVE, WIRED | Has git_commit, git_dirty, graph_hash, graph_file with option_env! capture |
| `crates/daq-egui/src/panels/code_preview.rs` | Syntax-highlighted code preview | EXISTS (211 lines), SUBSTANTIVE, WIRED | CodePreviewPanel with egui_code_editor, used in experiment_designer |
| `crates/daq-egui/src/panels/script_editor.rs` | Editable script mode | EXISTS (139 lines), SUBSTANTIVE, WIRED | ScriptEditorPanel with save/save_as, used via eject_to_script() |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|----|--------|---------|
| experiment_designer.rs | codegen.rs | `use graph_to_rhai_script` | WIRED | Line 15: import, Line 809/843: usage |
| experiment_designer.rs | code_preview.rs | `CodePreviewPanel` field | WIRED | Line 92: field, Line 227/230: update/render |
| experiment_designer.rs | script_editor.rs | `ScriptEditorPanel::from_graph_code` | WIRED | Line 845: construction on eject |
| code_preview.rs | codegen.rs | `graph_to_rhai_script(graph, None)` | WIRED | Line 52: call in update() |
| document.rs | build.rs env vars | `option_env!("VERGEN_GIT_SHA")` | WIRED | Line 493-494: captures git_commit, git_dirty |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| CODE-01: Live code preview pane | SATISFIED | CodePreviewPanel + toggle button "Show Code"/"Hide Code" |
| CODE-02: Export as standalone Rhai file | SATISFIED | "Export Rhai..." button + rfd::FileDialog |
| CODE-03: Switch to script editor mode | SATISFIED | "Eject to Script" button + confirmation + ScriptEditorPanel |
| CODE-04: Readable generated code with comments | SATISFIED | Each node type generates explanatory comments |

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| script_editor.rs | 55 | `// TODO: Connect to scripting engine execution` | Info | Run button placeholder - acceptable, requires Phase 8+ integration |

### Human Verification Required

All automated checks passed. The following items need human testing during normal usage:

### 1. Code Preview Live Update Test
**Test:** Add Scan node, configure, toggle "Show Code", verify code appears and updates
**Expected:** Right panel shows Rhai with for loop, move_abs, yield_event calls
**Why human:** Visual verification of syntax highlighting and layout

### 2. Export File Test
**Test:** Click "Export Rhai...", save file, open in text editor
**Expected:** File contains valid Rhai script with header comments and node code
**Why human:** File system interaction and content verification

### 3. Eject Mode Test
**Test:** Click "Eject to Script", confirm, verify editor appears
**Expected:** Script editor replaces graph, can edit, save, and "New Graph" returns
**Why human:** Mode switching UI behavior

### Gaps Summary

No gaps found. All five success criteria from ROADMAP.md are verified:

1. Live code preview - CodePreviewPanel with graph_version tracking ensures updates on edit
2. Export to .rhai - export_rhai_dialog() uses rfd and std::fs::write
3. Eject to script mode - ScriptEditorPanel with full save/edit capability
4. Readable code with comments - Every node_to_rhai() generates explanatory comments
5. Provenance tracking - ExperimentManifest captures git_commit, git_dirty, graph_hash, graph_file

### Test Results

```
cargo test -p daq-egui codegen
running 15 tests - all passed

cargo test -p daq-core document  
running 10 tests - all passed
```
