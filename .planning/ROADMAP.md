# Roadmap: Experiment Design Module

## Overview

Build a visual experiment designer for rust-daq that transforms how scientists create data acquisition experiments. Starting with a form-based scan builder to validate the core execution loop, we'll progressively add node-based visual editing, live execution control with pause/resume, real-time visualization, and complete data provenance. The journey delivers both a GUI-first workflow for novice users and code export capabilities for power users, all built on rust-daq's existing RunEngine and Plan architecture.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: SCAN-01, SCAN-02, EXEC-01, EXEC-02, VIZ-01, DATA-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can discover available devices from registry and select actuators/detectors
  2. User can configure 1D line scan (start/stop/points) and 2D grid scan via form fields
  3. User can start experiment and see live plot updating as data is acquired
  4. User can abort running experiment immediately, with data saved up to abort point
