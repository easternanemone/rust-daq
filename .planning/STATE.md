# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2025-01-22)

**Core value:** Scientists can design and interactively run experiments without writing code, while power users retain full programmatic control
**Current focus:** Phase 3 - Plan Translation and Execution

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 10 (Plan Translation and Execution)
Plan: 3 of TBD complete
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-22 - Completed 03-03-PLAN.md

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 29%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 10
- Average duration: 7.0min
- Total execution time: 1.2 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan | Status |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| 01 | 3 | 17min | 5.7min | Complete |
| 02 | 4 | 36min | 9.0min | Complete |
| 03 | 3 | 20min | 6.7min | In progress |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 02-04 (12min), 03-01 (7min), 03-02 (8min), 03-03 (5min)
- Trend: Fast execution (5min for 03-03)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Node-based visual editor chosen as primary interface (standard scientific workflow paradigm)
- One-way code generation established (visual is source of truth, code is export only)
- Parameter injection for live edits (RunEngine Checkpoint-based, structure immutable during execution)
- Context menu as primary node-add UX (more reliable than drag-drop with coordinate transforms)
- Unified GraphEdit enum for undo/redo (undo::Record<E> requires single E type)
- .expgraph file extension for experiment graphs (distinct from generic JSON)
- Validation errors in status bar + property inspector (avoids egui-snarl API complexity)
- Kahn's algorithm for cycle detection (standard, efficient O(V+E))
- Display cycle errors on first node (avoids overwhelming user with multiple errors)
- Skip per-node validation when cycle detected (cycles make execution impossible)
- Channel-based async communication for gRPC calls (non-blocking UI)
- ExecutionState cloned to viewer before render (cheap, avoids lifetime issues)
- Visual highlighting infrastructure ready (pending egui-snarl API support)
- Separate RuntimeParameterEditor from parameter_editor.rs (different use case: runtime vs device introspection)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Pre-existing test failure in graph::serialization::tests::test_version_check (not introduced by 03-01)
- egui-snarl lacks custom header color API (visual node highlighting infrastructure ready but not applied)
