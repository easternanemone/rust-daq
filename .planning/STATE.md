# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2025-01-22)

**Core value:** Scientists can design and interactively run experiments without writing code, while power users retain full programmatic control
**Current focus:** Phase 4 complete, ready for Phase 5

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 10 (Live Visualization) - COMPLETE
Plan: 4 of 4 complete
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-01-23 - Completed 05-05-PLAN.md (Live Visualization Streaming Integration)

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 49%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 18
- Average duration: 5.1min
- Total execution time: 1.5 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan | Status |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| 01 | 3 | 17min | 5.7min | ✓ Complete |
| 02 | 4 | 36min | 9.0min | ✓ Complete |
| 03 | 4 | 28min | 7.0min | ✓ Complete |
| 04 | 3 | 14min | 4.7min | ✓ Complete |
| 05 | 4 | 12min | 3.0min | ✓ Complete |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 04-03 (4min), 05-01 (3min), 05-02 (3min), 05-03 (4min), 05-04 (4min), 05-05 (2min)
- Trend: Exceptional velocity, Phase 5 averaged 3.0min/plan (best phase yet)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Node-based visual editor chosen as primary interface (standard scientific workflow paradigm)
- One-way code generation established (visual is source of truth, code is export only)
- Parameter injection for live edits (RunEngine Checkpoint-based, structure immutable during execution)
- Context menu as primary node-add UX (more reliable than drag-drop with coordinate transforms)
- Unified GraphEdit enum for undo/redo (undo::Record<E> requires single E type)
- .expgraph file extension for experiment graphs (distinct from generic JSON)
- Validation errors in status bar + property inspector (avoids egui-snarl API complexity)
- Kahn's algorithm for cycle detection (standard, efficient O(V+E))
- Display cycle errors on first node (avoids overwhelming user with multiple errors)
- Skip per-node validation when cycle detected (cycles make execution impossible)
- Channel-based async communication for gRPC calls (non-blocking UI)
- ExecutionState cloned to viewer before render (cheap, avoids lifetime issues)
- Visual highlighting infrastructure ready (pending egui-snarl API support)
- Separate RuntimeParameterEditor from parameter_editor.rs (different use case: runtime vs device introspection)
- Configuration structs for node variants (cleaner than inline fields, easier to extend)
- Custom autocomplete widget instead of egui_autocomplete (version compatibility issues)
- Optional exposure_ms field in AcquireConfig (None = use device default)
- Safety limits on infinite loops via max_iterations (prevents truly unbounded execution)
- Stateless DeviceSelector usage (created per-render) instead of storing as field
- Empty device_ids parameter triggers fallback to text field (graceful degradation)
- Condition/termination type change creates new default variant (prevents data loss until user confirms)
- Loop body nodes detected via body output (pin 1) BFS traversal
- Body nodes excluded from main topological traversal to prevent double-translation
- Condition-based loops use max_iterations as safety fallback with warning
- Relative moves in loop bodies generate warnings (position compounds each iteration)
- Back-edges from loop body to ancestors detected as errors (prevent infinite recursion)
- Grow-only bounds for plot axes (prevents jarring visual jumps during live acquisition)
- Per-axis lock independence (X and Y axes lockable separately)
- Grid dimensions via cols = ceil(sqrt(n)), rows = ceil(n/cols) (roughly square layouts)
- Nested StripBuilder for responsive grids (vertical rows, horizontal columns)
- DetectorType enum for mixed detector support (Camera, LinePlot in same grid)
- FPS tracking uses 2-second rolling window for stable metrics
- Camera frames displayed with aspect-preserving fit-to-panel logic
- Separate update channels for frames and data (bounded SyncSender)
- Simple heuristic for detector classification: device_id containing 'camera'/'cam' = camera, else plot
- Visualization panel created on execution start, marked inactive on stop (panel persists for review)
- Collapsing header UI pattern for live visualization (non-intrusive, user-collapsible)
- Camera streams use Preview quality (30 FPS) for live visualization bandwidth optimization
- Document stream subscribes to all documents, filters Event payloads client-side
- Stream tasks aborted on stop_visualization() for proper cleanup

### Pending Todos

- Device list async fetch from DaqClient in ExperimentDesignerPanel (TODO added in 04-02)

### Blockers/Concerns

- Pre-existing test failure in graph::serialization::tests::test_version_check (not introduced by 03-01)
- egui-snarl lacks custom header color API (visual node highlighting infrastructure ready but not applied)
- GraphPlan not queued to server yet (run_experiment TODO on line 855) - Phase 5 complete but awaits server integration

### Phase 3 Verification Notes

Human approved with 3/4 success criteria fully verified. Known gaps documented for future work:
1. GraphPlan not sent to server (UI-side translation complete, server integration deferred)
2. Visual node highlighting not activated (egui-snarl API limitation)
