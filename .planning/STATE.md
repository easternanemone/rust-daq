# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2025-01-22)

**Core value:** Scientists can design and interactively run experiments without writing code, while power users retain full programmatic control
**Current focus:** Phase 3 complete, ready for Phase 4

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 10 (Sequences and Control Flow) - COMPLETE
Plan: 3 of 3 complete
Status: Phase 4 complete, ready for Phase 5
Last activity: 2026-01-22 - Completed 04-03-PLAN.md (Loop Body Translation)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 37%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 14
- Average duration: 6.1min
- Total execution time: 1.7 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan | Status |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| 01 | 3 | 17min | 5.7min | ✓ Complete |
| 02 | 4 | 36min | 9.0min | ✓ Complete |
| 03 | 4 | 28min | 7.0min | ✓ Complete |
| 04 | 3 | 14min | 4.7min | ✓ Complete |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 03-04 (8min), 04-01 (6min), 04-02 (4min), 04-03 (4min)
- Trend: Fast execution continuing (4-8min), Phase 4 avg 4.7min is fastest yet

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Node-based visual editor chosen as primary interface (standard scientific workflow paradigm)
- One-way code generation established (visual is source of truth, code is export only)
- Parameter injection for live edits (RunEngine Checkpoint-based, structure immutable during execution)
- Context menu as primary node-add UX (more reliable than drag-drop with coordinate transforms)
- Unified GraphEdit enum for undo/redo (undo::Record<E> requires single E type)
- .expgraph file extension for experiment graphs (distinct from generic JSON)
- Validation errors in status bar + property inspector (avoids egui-snarl API complexity)
- Kahn's algorithm for cycle detection (standard, efficient O(V+E))
- Display cycle errors on first node (avoids overwhelming user with multiple errors)
- Skip per-node validation when cycle detected (cycles make execution impossible)
- Channel-based async communication for gRPC calls (non-blocking UI)
- ExecutionState cloned to viewer before render (cheap, avoids lifetime issues)
- Visual highlighting infrastructure ready (pending egui-snarl API support)
- Separate RuntimeParameterEditor from parameter_editor.rs (different use case: runtime vs device introspection)
- Configuration structs for node variants (cleaner than inline fields, easier to extend)
- Custom autocomplete widget instead of egui_autocomplete (version compatibility issues)
- Optional exposure_ms field in AcquireConfig (None = use device default)
- Safety limits on infinite loops via max_iterations (prevents truly unbounded execution)
- Stateless DeviceSelector usage (created per-render) instead of storing as field
- Empty device_ids parameter triggers fallback to text field (graceful degradation)
- Condition/termination type change creates new default variant (prevents data loss until user confirms)
- Loop body nodes detected via body output (pin 1) BFS traversal
- Body nodes excluded from main topological traversal to prevent double-translation
- Condition-based loops use max_iterations as safety fallback with warning
- Relative moves in loop bodies generate warnings (position compounds each iteration)
- Back-edges from loop body to ancestors detected as errors (prevent infinite recursion)

### Pending Todos

- Device list async fetch from DaqClient in ExperimentDesignerPanel (TODO added in 04-02)

### Blockers/Concerns

- Pre-existing test failure in graph::serialization::tests::test_version_check (not introduced by 03-01)
- egui-snarl lacks custom header color API (visual node highlighting infrastructure ready but not applied)

### Phase 3 Verification Notes

Human approved with 3/4 success criteria fully verified. Known gaps documented for future work:
1. GraphPlan not sent to server (UI-side translation complete, server integration deferred)
2. Visual node highlighting not activated (egui-snarl API limitation)
