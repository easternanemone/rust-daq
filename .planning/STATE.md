# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2025-01-22)

**Core value:** Scientists can design and interactively run experiments without writing code, while power users retain full programmatic control
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Form-Based Scan Builder

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Form-Based Scan Builder)
Plan: 2 of 3 complete
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-22 - Completed 01-02-PLAN.md (Execution controls and live plotting)

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 10%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 5.5min
- Total execution time: 0.2 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 2 | 11min | 5.5min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (6min), 01-02 (5min)
- Trend: Stable

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Node-based visual editor chosen as primary interface (standard scientific workflow paradigm)
- One-way code generation established (visual is source of truth, code is export only)
- Parameter injection for live edits (RunEngine Checkpoint-based, structure immutable during execution)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
